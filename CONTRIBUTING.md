## How to Contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dvanmali/terraform-google-surrealdb/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dvanmali/terraform-google-surrealdb/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the project will generally not be accepted and closed.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as a Draft PR request with the proposed changes in the PR description.

* Once the proposed changes are completed and ready for review, convert from Draft to Ready.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use SurrealDB on their [Discord](https://discord.gg/surrealdb).
